## About this Document

An enduring Materials Genome Foundation will remain aware of the needs of the next generation workforce. A sustainable plan can adapt as goals are met or cultural needs in the open materials science ecosystem shift. 

The MGF begins their commitment to openness by making their strategic plan an open, living document that can adapt to a rapidly changing technology landscape. New visions, goals, and objectives can be adopted as past objectives are met.  Calendar versioning will be used to distribute the strategic plans as software packages containing:

* The markdown source contents
* An exported PDF version of the document.
* Tooling to build the strategic plan.

More information in the [developer documents](DEVELOPER.md).
