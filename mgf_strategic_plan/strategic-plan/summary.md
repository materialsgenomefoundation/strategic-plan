# Executive Summary

```{admonition} MGF Vision
Advance open innovation in materials science by providing community services that increase open materials software, data, and research literacies.
```

The Materials Genome Foundation is established in 2023 - with funding through [__Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems__ NSF-<abbr title="Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems">POSE</abbr>][POSE] #[2229690][2229690] - to increase access to materials science and manufacturing literacy.
Materials science and manufacturing are facing increasingly complex engineering challenges that outpace traditional modes of research and development. Our proposed recourse is to develop and foster diverse, inclusive materials communities practicing open science that addresses modern emerging, interdisciplinary engineering problems.

Open science propels a new culture that broadly disseminate materials software, data, models, and research. Recent successes (eg Materials Genome Initiative, The Materials Project, Materials Data Facility) have ushered in a new materials economies that increase access data and software. The transition from an information poor to rich materials data economy will shift the needs of materials scientists and research. Open code and data seed communities, and these communities require support. The Materials Genome Foundation will provide community support and cultural influences necessary to sustain open materials science.

The Materials Genome Foundation will serve a complemntary role relative to established funding, policy, and infrastructure efforts. The MGF use traditional funding pathways along with open science funding, and the culture will be organically established through open governance. We'll build tools and infrastructure that connect the community and promote inclusive, diverse, open materials science.

The Materials Genome Foundation is prioritizing three goals to promote open materials science:

1. Fostering an Open Materials Science Community and Culture
2. Advancing the quality of open materials science tools
3. Provide services required for an open materials science economy


These goals will be acheived through a radically open approach to materials science that aligns more with open source software collaboration. These goals are designed to impact early career researchers that will operate in rapid, open, interdisciplinary research. The Materials Genome Foundation believes that a transparent, open approach will permit sustainable growth; it can adapt to the rapidly changing technical landscape of science.
