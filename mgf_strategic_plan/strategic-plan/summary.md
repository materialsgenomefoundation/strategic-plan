# Executive Summary

```{admonition} MGF Vision
Advance open innovation in materials science by providing community services that increase access to open materials software, data, and research.
```

The Materials Genome Foundation is established in 2023 - with funding through [__Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems__ NSF-<abbr title="Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems">POSE</abbr>][POSE] #[2229690][2229690] - to increase access to materials science and manufacturing literacy.
Materials science and manufacturing are facing increasingly complex engineering challenges that outpace traditional modes of research and development. Our proposed recourse is to develop and foster diverse, inclusive materials communities practicing open science, a new generation that broadly disseminate materials software, data, models, and research.

## WIP Below

> Federal agencies are celebrating 2023 as a Year of Open Science, a multi-agency initiative across the federal government to spark change and inspire open science engagement through events and activities that will advance adoption of open, equitable, and secure science.

Open science is a necessary movement. In 2023, the #YearofOpenScience, 16 US Federal Science agencies 
Open science is a vision for collaborative, interdisciplinary research spanning many lengths and timescales. The MGF hopes to align the materials sciences will open science practices consistent with large scale research efforts like NASA-TOPS or USGS. Open science is an affront the conventional closed research practices. 

Materials science needs more diversity

Education and re-training
Funding is increasing
 


* open materials needed to solve modern emerging, interdisciplinary problems
* increased access to software and data require new approaches
