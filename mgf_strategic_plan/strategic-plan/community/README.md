```

## Establish an online community of practice for open materials scientists

* increase access to the materials science community
* Online Discord community
* Demo Days
* Create more opportunities to practice communication

## Host immersive, hands-on open materials science software workshops

* Design and host immersive virtual workshops using JupyterHub

## Generate new media to represent materials science

* future materials scientists will discover the discipline through alternative media channels than those presently supported.
* catering to publications and print media limits participation in the field.
* the mgf will encourage and amplify new ways of representing complex simulations and observations about materials.
* recently, stsci has been lauded for accessible alt text descriptions for public images captured by the james webb space telescope.
* [scientific python] communities are active on tiktok.
