# Fostering an Open Materials Science Community

```{important}
The MGF will grow online communities of materials scientists across generations, disciplines and expertise.
```

Open science practices overlap with the open source movement and provide us with valuable to build a more inclusive science from. [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/community "An open source content management system")'s motto - <q>Come for the Software, Stay for the Community</q> - teaches us a lesson that tireless community work supports successful open communities. 

The Materials Genome Foundation understands the need for diverse communities of experts. Community is a primary goal. The MGF understands that the quality of our sponsored software projects and services all depend on an equitable community. These goals motivate our demo day and digital community initiatives.

## Establish an online community of practice for open materials scientists

Open science is a commitment to more frequent interactions with other experts. Work will be shared more freque  

We want to increase the frequency that materials researchers commune. Increasing synchronous and asynchronous interactions propels 

Open science is spread across infrastructure

> wide-scale adoption of OS practices requires a culture change that leads to normalization among members of the scientific community.

* increase access to the materials science community
* Online Discord community
* Demo Days
* Create more opportunities to practice communication

## Host immersive, hands-on open materials science software workshops



* Design and host immersive virtual workshops using JupyterHub

## Generate new media to represent materials science

* future materials scientists will discover the discipline through alternative media channels than those presently supported.
* catering to publications and print media limits participation in the field.
* the mgf will encourage and amplify new ways of representing complex simulations and observations about materials.
* recently, stsci has been lauded for accessible alt text descriptions for public images captured by the james webb space telescope.
* [scientific python] communities are active on tiktok.
