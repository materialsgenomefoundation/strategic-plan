# Advance the quality of open materials science software tools

> Nurture and develop sustainable open source software projects that increase access to quality materials data, theory, and models.

* open-source is a core value of the MGF that will increase access to a materials science identities.
* the MGF will align materials research with open software goverance to increase the scope of materials science work and those that can participate.
  * reducing geographical boundaries to materials science research is critical the development of advanced materials manufacturing.
* shepherd a culture of opening closed software. pycalphad is a success story in making a block box technical a community good.

## Grow a porfolio of endorsed open materials science software projects

* MGF endorsed projects
  * have a maintainer
  * have a way to communicate with their community
  * have tests, documentation, continuous integration
  * are not expected to survive in perpetuity
  
* Existing: PyCalphad, Kawin
* Use existing <abbr title="Community Health Analytics in Open Source Software">CHAOSS</abbr> metrics to understand the qualities of materials science projects.[^chaoss]

## Provide open software and documentation that brings best practices to open materials research software engineering

* the MGF will own open software projects themselves.
  * [documentation projects build community][docs-community] and increase the potential contributor base.
  * MGF projects provide sandboxes for community management and project planning.
* nurture and support early materials research in their earliest open source community efforts

## Improve software bill of materials quality for materials science research software

* increase access to open standards that manage [supply chain levels for software artifacts][slsa] and [software bill of materials][SBOM] for early research artifacts. 
* improve quality assurance and supply chain risk management in materials manufacturing
* most materials science software we remain small in scale with few contributors. SBOM and SLSA
