# Improve the quality of open materials science tools

> Nurture and develop sustainable open source software projects that increase access to quality materials data, theory, and models.

* Happy Developers/Communities, happy software.
* There is a growth of materials science work in the open.
  * Thanks to MGI
* Make closed sourced software publicly available ala pycalphad

## Grow a porfolio of endorsed open materials science software projects

* what are MGF-endorsed software projects?
  * projects we contribute to and demostrate to the community.
  * if it is endorsed, it is sustained. 
  * in a software poor economy, metrics come later.

* PyCalphad, Kawin, 
* CHAOSS measures

## Identify and provide resources for best practices in open materials research software engineering

* treat documentation as software you we increase the surface of available contributors.
* how do we open materials science. https://www.pyopensci.org/ + materials science
* early on we'll nurture projects where we think there are needs.
