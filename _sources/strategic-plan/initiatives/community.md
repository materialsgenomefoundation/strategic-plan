# Establishing An Open Materials Science Community

A primary objective of the earliest Materials Genome Foundation will be to connect communities working at the intersections of materials science, artificial intelliegence, and research software engineering. Materials and manufacturing still rely on costly and infrequent in-person community meetups. Closed science practices serve the existing community by creating barriers for new members to join. 

The Materials Genome Foundation will contribute the growth of an online materials science community. These efforts will increase access to open materials science events.

has identified community and community development as a critical need for the open materials science movement.

The Materials Genome Foundation recognizes that open source code seeds community. The MGF desires to serve a diverse community of multi generational and interdisciplinary researchers cooperatively sharing research, data, and code.

## Open workshops

The Materials Genome Foundation demonstrates a commitment to open science by providing access to their workshop materials. 

Early in 2023, with support from the POSE program, the Materials Genome Foundation hosted a one day workshop on pySIPFENN, an MGF endorsed projects.

## Demo Day

The Materials Genome Foundation will increase opportunites for scientific communication.
An open community format.
MGF-RSE's will help with coordinate things

There is a lack of opportunity for up-and-coming materials scientists to practice scientific communication. 

## A Discord Community for Materials Science and Manufacturing

Not Open

The Open Materials and Manufacturing Discord is an initiative to sustain a community of materials and manufacturing researchers.
The Materials Genome Foundation supports this initiative to increase access to materials science community and accelerate open knowledge sharing. The Discord community will serve as a place for interdisciplinary, multi-generation research discussions at the boundaries of materials science and open source.

* spend time supporting our immediate sponsored projects.
* spend time supporting other folks in the long term
